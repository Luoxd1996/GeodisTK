# Implementation of geodesic distance transforms for 2d and 3d images
Geodesic transformation of images can be implementated with two approaches: fast marching and raster scan. Fast marching is based on the iterative propagation of a pixel front with velocity F [1]. Raster scan is based on kernel operations that are sequentially applied over the image in multiple passes [2]. In GeoS[3], the authors proposed to use a 3x3 kernel for forward and backward passes for efficient geodesic distance transform, which was used for image segmentation.  

DeepIGeoS[4] proposed to combine geodesic distance transforms with convolutional neural networks for efficient interactive segmentation of 2D and 3D images.
